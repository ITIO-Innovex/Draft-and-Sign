          question: "How much can file size be reduced?",
          answer: "Reduction varies based on content, but PDFs with many images typically see 30-80% size reduction while maintaining good visual quality."
        },
        {
          question: "Will text quality be affected?",
          answer: "No, our compression focuses only on images. Text, fonts, and vector elements remain crisp and clear with no quality loss."

        {
          question: "What's the difference between compression levels?",
          answer: "Light compression maintains highest image quality with minimal size reduction. High compression achieves maximum size reduction but may show some visual differences in images."
        },
        {
          question: "How does image resizing work?",
          answer: "We can reduce the resolution of overly large images to a specified DPI (dots per inch), which significantly reduces file size while maintaining appropriate quality for your needs."

          question: "How secure are my files during processing?",

        {
          question: "Is this tool really free to use?",

          question: "Why do you delete files automatically?",

          question: "Do I need to create an account to use this tool?",

          question: "What happens if my internet connection is interrupted?",
          answer: "If your connection is interrupted during upload, you can resume the upload when reconnected. Processed files are temporarily stored for 1 hour."
