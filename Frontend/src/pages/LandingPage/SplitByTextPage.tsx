          question: "How does splitting by text work?",

        {
          question: "Can I split a scanned PDF by text?",
          answer: "Yes, we use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to detect text in scanned documents, though accuracy depends on scan quality."
        },
        {
          question: "What's the difference between split behaviors?",
          answer: "Splitting before text puts the matching text at the start of the new file. Splitting after puts it at the end of the current file. Splitting on excludes the text entirely."

        {
          question: "Can I use regular expressions for complex patterns?",

          question: "How secure are my files during processing?",

        },
        {
          question: "How long do you store my files?",
          answer: "We automatically delete all uploaded files after 1 hour for your privacy and security. You can also manually delete files immediately after processing."

        {
          question: "Is this tool really free to use?",

        {
          question: "Why do you delete files automatically?",

          question: "Do I need to create an account to use this tool?",
