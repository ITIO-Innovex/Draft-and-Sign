        {
          question: "How accurate is the size splitting?",
          answer: "Our algorithm aims to keep each part under your specified size limit while maintaining page integrity. Actual sizes may vary slightly due to content complexity."

        {
          question: "What's the difference between splitting methods?",
          answer: "Adaptive method optimizes for content, equal size creates parts of similar size, and page boundary method only splits at complete pages."

        {
          question: "Will the quality be affected?",
          answer: "No, splitting by size maintains the original quality of all content. If you enable optimization, there may be slight quality reduction to achieve smaller sizes."
